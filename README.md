Web Scanner Tool Description

Web Scanner is a security tool designed to detect common vulnerabilities in websites and web applications. It helps users scan websites for potential security issues such as SQL Injection, XSS, LFI, RFI, CSRF, and SSRF. These vulnerabilities can allow attackers to exploit websites, steal sensitive data, or gain unauthorized access to systems.

Key Features of the Tool:

1. SQL Injection Scanning:

Detects potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to execute unauthorized SQL queries in the database.



2. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Scanning:

Checks for the possibility of injecting malicious JavaScript code into the website, which could be executed on the users' browsers.



3. LFI (Local File Inclusion) Scanning:

Looks for vulnerabilities that may allow attackers to load local files from the server, such as /etc/passwd.



4. RFI (Remote File Inclusion) Scanning:

Checks for the ability to include remote files, enabling attackers to load harmful files from external servers.



5. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Scanning:

Detects CSRF vulnerabilities that may allow attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.



6. SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) Scanning:

Detects SSRF vulnerabilities that could enable attackers to send requests from the server to internal systems or external targets.




Additional Features:

Internet Connection Check: Verifies the availability of an internet connection before scanning.

User-Friendly Output: Displays the results in a clear, readable format with options to export the scan results into an HTML report.


This tool helps web developers and security researchers identify and fix security flaws in web applications, reducing the risk of exploitation and enhancing website security.
